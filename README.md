# Heart Diseases Prediction
> We have a Data of patient lifestyle information. We have to Create a machine learning Model to Predict risk of heart diseases and Evaluate the Accuracy Score 


## General Information
### Siuation : 
 - We have a data of human body and Habits like smoking, cholesterol level etc..

### Task : 
 - Predict risk of heart diseases from patient lifestyle information.

### Action : 
 - Use Logistic Regression with pca feature selection.
 - Use Random Forest

### Result : 
 - From the PCA we conclude that 100% data variance can be explained by 6 components
 - Accuracy Score of **Logistic Regression** is 68%.
 - Accuracy Score of **Random Forest** is 71%.
